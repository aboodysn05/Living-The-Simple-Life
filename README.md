🛠️ Technologies Used

HTML5
CSS3 (Flexbox, Media Queries)

📱 Responsive Features

The site is fully responsive with two breakpoints:

Desktop (>768px): Multi-column layout with sidebar
Tablet (≤768px): Stacked layout with adjusted spacing
Mobile (≤480px): Single column with optimized typography

💡 Key Takeaways

This project taught me that responsive design isn't just about making things fit on smaller screens—it's about rethinking the layout to provide the best user experience on any device. I learned to:

Start with mobile layout first, then enhance for larger screens
Use relative units (em, %) instead of fixed pixels where possible
Keep CSS organized with clear comments
Create reusable components that work across multiple pages
